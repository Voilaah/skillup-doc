# SkillUp Integration

SkillUp can handle multiple types of integration with our partner's platform.


## Course Integration

SkillUp can perform two types of courses integration:

- [complete integration](/integration/courses/list) of your courses content (except medias) in SkillUp platform
- partial integration of your courses (course preview page) in SkillUp platform
- data analytics (i.e.: courses enrollment, course grade, ... )

## Student Integration

SkillUp can import your users directly into the platform to allow them to authenticate and start learning seamlessly.
