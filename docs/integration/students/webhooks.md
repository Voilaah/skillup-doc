## Student webhook

Webhooks are event-driven communication between two platforms through an API.

Webhooks are useful when you want to connect to the SkillUp platform from your platform.

Triggered by specific events on your platform (ex: course creation, course update, course deletion, lesson creation, lesson update, lesson deletion...), webhooks automate communication between APIs and can be used to update SkillUp platform.
